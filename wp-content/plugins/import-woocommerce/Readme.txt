The size of the file is based on the Upload size of your server configuration. The upload_max_filesize should be at least 2M. You can verify your system values in settings -> security and performance.
   
2. Can we include an external URL for image import? <br />
Featured image can be imported from an external URL but inline image can be populated only through shortcode.

Inline images in content can be included with shortcodes. Images in shortcode need to be uploaded with zip folder containing images with exact names mentioned in shortcode.
